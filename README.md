# Better Touch

## Idea
Make this program into "Better Touch", a command-line tool for creating new files
that is faster than `touch` because it allows you to specify the file extension once,
then lets you type all the file names of that type you want. Therefore,
you only need to type the file extension once, saving time by allowing you to
omit the file extension when creating multiple files of the same extension.

The program should also be able to install itself.

## To-Do List
- [ ] Make the program install itself
- [ ] Allow user to choose file extension first

## Follow Up Program
- [ ] Create an improved `mkdir` command for creating folders
